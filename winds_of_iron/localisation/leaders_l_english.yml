 POLITICS_ALFONSO_XIII_DESC:0 "Alfonso XIII of Spain was born in 1894 during the reign of his mother, Isabel II, with the title of Prince of Asturias since his birth. Isabel spent much of her time educating the young Alfonso in state affairs, just like her grandfather Javier did to her several decades ago. However, in 1908, an unexpected tragedy ocurred when an anarchist group detonated a bomb in the Gran Vía of Madrid as Isabel and her family passed, killing the Queen, his consort, and one of Alfonso's brothers, leaving the country in mourning for several days, after which Alfonso, as Isabel's heir, was crowned King, and a Regency Council established until Alfonso reaches his sixteenth birthday. Although the young Alfonso inherited the intelligence and capacity of his mother, Spain is in trouble, and a conflict with Chile over Chiloé and Perú seems inevitable, so it is critical for Alfonso to think well of his decisions."
 POLITICS_RUDOLF_I_DESC:0 "Rudolf I is the current emperor of Austria after his father abdicated in 1892. Since then, Rudolf has lead Austria down a path of federation and recognition of the Empire's ethnical minorities, which gives hope for the Habsburg Monarchy's survival into the twentieth century. \n\nBorn in 1858, Rudolf's libertarian ideas soon conflicted with those of his father, of conservative and centralist ideals, causing resentment with the current austrian system to grow within the back-then Crown Prince.  \n\nRecently, the Austrian Constitution of 1907 symbolized the compromise between the Emperor, the high classes, and the minorities living in the Austrian Empire, although opposition still exists, mainly in Hungary, where the local aristocrats ask for the incorporation of the Crowns of Croatia and Bosnia into Hungary."
